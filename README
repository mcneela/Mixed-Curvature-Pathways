mds-scale.jl is the main script. It has 3 arguments, data_set (an integer between 1 and 14, corresponding to stuff in data_prep.py and the data folder), the dimension k, and the parameter epsilon.

It's currently spitting out a ton of stuff, since I'm a little worried about how long the power method will take on the bigger graphs.

This has the change where we throw away the negative evals and the corresponding components. 

We run this with bash scripts like exp5.sh which need a little love to look more elegant and to sweep over more stuff.

data_prep.py is just a big switch that loads graphs from the data folder. I'm running on the datasets of interest - that's the numbers in the bash script.
